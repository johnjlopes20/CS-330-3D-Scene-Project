**Reflection on 3D Scene Project
How do I approach designing software?**
I approach designing software by first understanding the problem thoroughly and then breaking it down into manageable components. I emphasize user needs and usability while ensuring the architecture supports scalability and maintainability.

**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
This project has enhanced my ability to create more intuitive and user-friendly interfaces and improve my architectural planning skills to ensure better integration and functionality of different software components.

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**
I followed an iterative design process, starting with requirements gathering, followed by creating wireframes and prototypes, seeking feedback, and continuously refining the design based on user input and testing results.

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
Tactics such as iterative prototyping, user-centered design, and continuous feedback loops can be applied in future projects to ensure that the end product meets user needs and adapts well to changing requirements.

**How do I approach developing programs?**
I approach program development with a focus on writing clean, modular, and well-documented code. I prioritize understanding the requirements, planning the architecture, and iterating based on testing and feedback.

**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**
While working on my 3D scene, I adopted strategies such as using reusable code components, leveraging libraries and frameworks for 3D rendering, and incorporating performance optimization techniques.

**How did iteration factor into your development?**
Iteration was crucial, allowing me to test and refine the 3D scene continuously. Each iteration provided insights into what worked well and what needed improvement, leading to a more polished and functional final product.

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**
My approach has evolved to become more structured and methodical, with greater emphasis on planning, testing, and incorporating feedback at each milestone to ensure steady progress and high-quality outcomes.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
Computer science equips me with problem-solving skills, technical knowledge, and the ability to create innovative solutions, which are essential in achieving my career and personal goals.
